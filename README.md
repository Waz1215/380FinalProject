For my project, I aim to recreate iconic scenes from 3 Studio Ghibli Films, which are some of my favorites movies of all time.
They are 2D, hand-drawn movies, and my focus for this assignment will be placing some of the original 2D elements in new 3D contexts using three.js, and perhaps adding some interactivity if possible. I will also try to incorporate some sound design in a meaningful way.

## First Page
For my first page, I will recreate a scene from the film, Spirited Away, in which the main character rides a train that crosses the ocean. During this scene, the whole wide open ocean and sky are beautifully drawn, and I will instead render the ocean and sky in 3D. The train and its riders will be drawn in 2D, and I may allow the user to change the direction of the train with their mouse.

## Second Page
The second page will feature a scene from the film, My Neighbor Totoro, in which the titular character is holding an umbrella during a rain storm at a bus stop. I will display Totoro and the bus stop elements in 2D, but the rain drops will be rendered in 3D, and the user will be able to rotate around Totoro so that the 3D aspect of the rain will be more prominent.

## Third Page
The third page is based off the film, Kikiâ€™s Delivery Service, where the main character Kiki is a witch, and an important part of the movie is her ability to fly on her broomstick. For this, I will draw her on her broomstick in 2D, and the background will be some sort of 3D landscape (a city perhaps) which the user can move around using their mouse.
